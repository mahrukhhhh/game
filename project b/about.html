        as my final project for ccLab, i had a lot of fun experimenting with this and trying out things to make this game work. it is an idle game, meant to be played leisurely. it was inspired by a blend of modern simplistic game art-styles and retro gameplay. it combines the visuals and addictive clicker nature to meld into something aesthetic and addictive. i hoped you liked this and the work that was put into it, thank you to professor Moon for the help he gave! I hope you all like playing~
